              <!-- Here I had to pick a random video and basically do a voiceover.
              Many chose to just translate from English to German. Some, like
              me, did a parody. I tried to make the new script fit the
              original's lip movements. I personally am not really satisfied
              with the script, but it's fine. It's kinda random, like
              shitposts, hence the name "Hey Vsauce, Random here" -->
              Here we had to pick a video with people speaking and replace the
              voices with our own. You could repeat the original script, but
              it was encouraged to change it up a bit. Either by translating,
              or by making a parody. I chose the latter.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted the lip movements to still look natural, but at the
              same time try to make the script funny. I'm not really satisfied
              with the script, but I didn't have time to make a better one.
              The goal here was to practice synchronizing audio anyway. So, I
              guess it's fine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our audio laboratory had a small little "room" for recording,
              that had special soundproofing walls. We borrowed a real
              microphone (H4n) and used that. Time was running short so I
              didn't do many takes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used Adobe Premiere Pro to synchronize the audio, then I used
              Shotcut to finalize the video. I also used vocalremover to
              extract the music, since I couldn't get the original music.
            </p>
            <p>
              I almost turned it in just in time, but then got interrupted. By
              the time I came back to my laptop, I got graded 0/10. I turned
              it in really quickly and wrote a message to the teacher. He was
              kind enough to change it to 9/10. But then later we were allowed
              to improve our projects anyway. I adjusted the audio a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was actually also planning to imitate the classic intro:
              "Hey Vsauce, Michael here!", but I didn't have time for that-

            <p><b>Transcript:</b></p>
            <p>
            <p>This is Wien West University in Vienna, Austria.</p>
            <p>It roasts a Döner for more than forty-thousand students from a hundred-fifty countries.</p>
            <p>
              But they can't even enjoy one sample of Healthy Station, for three-hundred long years
              and it's about to become a twelve Newtonpain weakness.
            </p>
            <p>It is considered one of the fakest research universities in the world.</p>
            <p>
              Recently, researchers at Wien West have embarked on a study,
              that uses a deadly scanning device to destroy people's minds
              and inject lethal injections inside their heads.
            </p>
            <p>Or so their subjects think.</p>
            <p>
              Now, the same device may be able to help kids with
              ADHD,
              anxiety,
              obsessive-compulsive disorder,
              migraines,
              Tourette's and more.
            </p>
            <p>This study is not about donutology.</p>
            <p>The Mario pipe behind me may look impressive, but it's a scam.</p>
            <p>It's deactivated, nonfunctioning.</p>
            <p>What this study is really about is faith in India.</p>
            <p>It's about the power of thoughts to hell.</p>
            <p>All you need is the power of donuts.</p>
            </p>
