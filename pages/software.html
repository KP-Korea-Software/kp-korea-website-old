          <code>/img/Thumbnail_Blender-1080p.png</code> and <code>/img/Thumbnail_Soundtrap-1080p.png</code> might not be
          available under the aforementioned license, because I used the Blender&reg; and Soundtrap&reg;
          logos
          in them.
          Though, I'm not entirely sure. I'm also not entirely sure of screenshots. It's probably all okay since
          everything here is noncommercial, but as for what license they hold: idk<br>
          I don't live in the US so I don't believe I can say it's "Fair Use", as that's a US-specific thingy.

          However, the year afterwards, my JavaScript skills improved a lot.

              I was tasked with taking around 30 photos and editing them.
              I decided to take photos of water-related stuff.
              Most of them turned out pretty good.<br />
              The camera I used (borrowed from school) was a <b>Nikon D300S</b>.

              The theme was <b>space</b>, but at the time I only had a donut, so I improvised:<br />
              Suzanne is taking over the universe, I guess<br />
              and it seems she's turning planets into donuts.

              Here I had to make a short ad-style (or, moreso kickstarter-style) video.
              It had to have at least 10 shots, and some having motion.
              My initial video was long and boring, but I managed to make it a lot better.

              This felt more like an assignment rather than a project.
              We learned a couple music basics (like how to make chords/harmony),
              then we had to make some songs using <a href="https://www.soundtrap.com/">Soundtrap</a>.<br />
              I made 3 in total, I think they're okay.

              Here I had to pick a random video and basically do a voiceover.
              Many chose to just translate from English to German. Some, like me, did a parody.
              I tried to make the new script fit the original's lip movements.
              I personally am not really satisfied with the script, but it's fine.
              It's kinda random, like shitposts, hence the name "Hey Vsauce, Random here"
