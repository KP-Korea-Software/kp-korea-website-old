          I don't think I'll fix these, so, it'll be like an "archive".<br />
          So by looking into this repo in <code>/pages/cookie-clicker-pro</code>

          you can see how "good" my JavaScript skills were back then.

        <p>
          However, the year afterwards, my JavaScript skills improved a lot.

              I was tasked with taking around 30 photos and editing them.
              I decided to take photos of water-related stuff.
              Most of them turned out pretty good.<br />
              The camera I used (borrowed from school) was a <b>Nikon D300S</b>.

              The theme was <b>space</b>, but at the time I only had a donut, so I improvised:<br />
              Suzanne is taking over the universe, I guess<br />
              and it seems she's turning planets into donuts.

              Here I had to make a short ad-style (or, moreso kickstarter-style) video.
              It had to have at least 10 shots, and some having motion.
              My initial video was long and boring, but I managed to make it a lot better.

              This felt more like an assignment rather than a project.
              We learned a couple music basics (like how to make chords/harmony),
              then we had to make some songs using <a href="https://www.soundtrap.com/">Soundtrap</a>.<br />
              I made 3 in total, I think they're okay.

              Here I had to pick a random video and basically do a voiceover.
              Many chose to just translate from English to German. Some, like me, did a parody.
              I tried to make the new script fit the original's lip movements.
              I personally am not really satisfied with the script, but it's fine.
              It's kinda random, like shitposts, hence the name "Hey Vsauce, Random here"
