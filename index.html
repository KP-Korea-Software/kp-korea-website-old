        <p>Short update:</p>
        <p>
          I have now added a <a href="/pages/legal.html">Legal page</a> cuz I felt like it and wanted to. But also
          because I think it's good practice.<br>
          <b>Notice:</b> I, now (for the time being), consider this website <b>outdated</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My computers, OSes, and development environments are pretty much set up now, and
          I'm still, very slowly, working on
          <a href="https://github.com/Talon125/talon-vue-sass-template">
            https://github.com/Talon125/talon-vue-sass-template
          </a>
          and have yet to come back to working on Tetra Legends Ultimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also decided I want to try learning Rust, and may use this language for future projects.<br>
          So, I guess I'll be "juggling" these 3 things for the time being.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll try not to procrastinate too much, but I can't guarantee anything.<br>
          That'll be all for now. Cya~!&nbsp;&nbsp;:3

          Hey, all! I've graduated, basically; finished school! This means I can slowly start to focus on my website
          and other stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm organizing a lot of personal matters, including my laptop and desktop. I've been archiving and
          backing things up. I think after I've set up my ideal environments, I can come back to this site and Tetra
          Legends Ultimate. It'll probably be in an order like:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Operating System*</li>
          <li>Setting up VS Code (profiles, extensions)</li>
          <li>Figuring out how to manage or what to do with both my GitHub accounts</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          *That brings me to what I'm currently doing. I'm experimenting with making Windows 10 (IoT Enterprise LTSC)
          look like Windows Vista/7. After trying it out in VMware (which is now free, woo!), I'll try it on my laptop
          and see if it's "worth it".
        </p>
        <p>
          It's kinda sorta (my) tradition to reinstall my laptop's OS(es) at the end of every school year. I might
          dual-boot Windows and Linux again, idk yet. I also want to "clean up" some other machines I got at home.
          KDE Plasma 6 also really interests me, and I have yet to try it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting back to working on my website also involves this, check it out:<br />

            https://github.com/Talon125/talon-vue-sass-template
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, that'll be all for this little update. There are many things I want to do, and each of them will
          take a while. Cya later~!&nbsp;&nbsp;:3
        </p>
        <h2 class="mt-5">Status as of 2023-09-03:</h2>
        <p>
          I've been real busy as of late because this summer I've had to focus on Diplomarbeit (thesis/dissertation),
          as well as finish my Praktikum (job/working experience).<br />
          So, unfortunately, I haven't been able to put as much focus as I'd liked on
          this website and Tetra Legends Ultimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final grade of HTL, 5th grade (cumulative/total: 13th grade), is about to start.
          Considering that I already have to work on my Diplomarbeit, with school work and stuff on top of that, I'm not
          sure how much free time I'll really have.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Point being:</b>
          I have <i>not</i> abandoned my website nor Tetra Legends Ultimate, and I still have plans for both!<br />
